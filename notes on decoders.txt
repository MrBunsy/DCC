DCC Concepts Zen decoders:

Work, but:
 - They seem to take a while to start the motor, despite fiddling with min voltage and acceleration settings.
 - They don't seem to power the motor enough when acknowledging CV reads for my hardware to sense the ack, so I can't read them.
 - The (really good idea) capacitor pack doesn't fit in any of my N gauge locos - might fit in a steam tender though.
